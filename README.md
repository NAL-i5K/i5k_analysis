This module provides the bundle configuration the Analysis bundle.  It was designed for the i5k Tripal 3 site.

Please note that it assumes that your Analysis bundle == bio_data_2.  You can check the bundle numbers on your site by looking at the constructed URL when you visit Admin -> Structure -> Tripal Content Types.
